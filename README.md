#Milestone Project 4 - Cardiff Magic Society

## Project aim

The aim of the project is to build a functional website for Cardiff Magic Society

## Background

Cardiff Magic Society is club based in cardiff for magicians and people interested in magic. The club holds regular monthly meetings which involve performances, lectures, social gatherings, workshops and other events. The society also has its own magic supply for members to buy magic items. As the working of magic is secret the society only allows the genral public access to certain areas of the societies activities for example some meetings are members only meetings.

### Why a website

The society use to have a website for members or anyone interested detailing when the meetings were and how to join. Members had issues with the site as it was hard to update and manage, didnt have much useful information and didnt look like a creditable site. Recently they switched to just using social media, however they have run into issues with this approach. Not all members on social media, and not all members on social media use the same platforms meaning more social media accounts are needed to be maintained and updated regularly.
A new functional website will give all members or anyone interested one location to find all the information about the society.

## Website features

### Research

To find out what they want for the website I had a meeting with the society board members and general mebers about what they would like to see from a website for the club. The main reoccuring points were :

- up to date calender on society upcoming events
- a private disscussion space for members
- mordern looking website which is easy to navigate
- a members only section
- up to date news on the magic world
- access to magic shop
- access to videos of past lectures
- to advertise members private performnce services
- how to join the society 
- Gallery of photos taken at meetings
- An easy to maintain website, easily updateable calender, gallery, news

### Website Needs

To incorporate what the society wants from a website I have broken down the requirements into website pages for the site

- About : describing the society and what its about
- Contact : how to get in contact with the society and where it meets
- How to join : how to join the society
- Gallery : pictures from society meetings
- Magicians for hire : advertisements of magic services from members
- Profile : a private individual area for members to update their own information.
- shop : to sell society product online
- latest news : up to date news on magic in the wider world
- Library : an archive of video media of past lectures 
- Message Board : an online chat board for members to post messages to everyone in th group

### Design Needs

- Modern looking : proffesional looking website
- Easy Navigation : the website should be intuitive to navigate
- Easy to update : Key areas that regularly change need to be easy for a user to modify eg. calender, latest news
- Restricted Access : members only information restricted from public access
- All devices : Website should function on all size screens

### User Needs

Due to the nature of the society I have identified four different types of users who would be accessing the website each with their own user story:

- The General Public : Anyone browsing the internet, or looking for magic content
- Assoiciate Member : Someone with an inerest in or performs magic but is not a society member
- Member : A paid up member of the society
- Admin Member : A member of the society who is in charge of updating calender and events
